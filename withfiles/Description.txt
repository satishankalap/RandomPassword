This is a small project for generating 16 digits random password,which includes 4 numbers,4 alphabets and again 4 numbers with 4 alphabets.User need to pass the username.

Here we are not using any Database for storing the username and the random password.Instead we use text file to store the data.

If user enters the username which is already stored in the file then it should prompt some message called "username already exists".
